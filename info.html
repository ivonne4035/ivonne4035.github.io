    <h2>What is a Butterfly?</h2>
    <blockquote>
     Butterflies are beautiful, flying insects with large scaly wings. 
     Like all insects, they have six jointed legs, 3 body parts, a pair of antennae, compound eyes, and an exoskeleton. 
     The three body parts are the head, thorax (the chest), and abdomen (the tail end).
