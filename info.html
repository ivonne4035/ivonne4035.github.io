    <h2>What is a Butterfly?</h2>
    <blockquote>
     Butterflies are extremely beautiful, flying insects with large scaly wings. 
     Like all insects, they have compound eyes, six jointed legs, a pair of antennae, 3 body parts, and an exoskeleton. 
     The three body parts are the head, thorax (the chest), and abdomen (the tail end).
     It;s body is covered by tiny hairs. Their six legs and four wings are attached to the thorax which contains the muscles for the lengs and wings.
