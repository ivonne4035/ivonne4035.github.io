          <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>Most notable feature is the variarity of colours or patterns and their wings.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample of butterflies with different colours and patterns.</p>

    <h3>Life cycle of butterflies</h3>
    <img src= "http://www.cocoon.org/images/imagesgeneral/lifecycle.jpg" width=350 height=300>
    <p>The butterfy cycle consists on four stages which are egg, larva, pupa, and adult. </p>
    <p>The first stage, Egg, is known when the moth deposits the fetilized eggs on an appropiate host plant. </p> 
    <p>Then that's how the beginning of their life cycle starts. </p>
    <p>After the is egg is develop, that's when the larva hatches from the egg. In other wrods, the larva is the caterpillars </p>
    <p>The first instar is when it grows way too big for its cuticle, it starts to molt. It should take a break from eating because it preprares to molt.</p>
    <p>The second instar is when it </p>
    <p>The pupal stage is when the transformation happens. this stage can be known as the resting stage.</p>
    <p>During this stage, the pupa does not eats nor moves when it is inside the cocoon. </p>
    <p>After the pupal case is completed, the moth will rest unitl it the appropiate time and it will time to emerge.</p>
    <p>Changes of temperature, chemical signals, light may start the adults emergence from the cocoon.</p>
    <p>The imago (adult) emerges from its pupal with a shriveled wing and swollen abdomen. The moth/butterfly will pump hemolymph  into the veins in its wings to expand them</p>
    <p>After the wings are fully expanded and dried, the moth can fly and start searching for a mate. </p>
